# fuse-stream

## explanation

- fuse-stream has the goal to combine multiple api's of different music streaming services to create a "remote control" for these services. You could then create a playlist and put songs in it from multiple services and hear them without needing to change the app or website.

- planned api's:
    - spotify (only possible with premium)
    - soundcloud
    - youtube music (unsure)
