# fuse-stream

## explanation

- fuse-stream has the goal to combine multiple api's of different music streaming services to create a "remote control" for these services. You could then create a playlist and put songs in it from multiple services and hear them without needing to change the app or website.

- planned api's:
    - spotify (only possible with premium)
    - soundcloud
    - youtube music (unsure)
 
- planned OS support:
    - Windows
    - Linux
    - Android

## concept

- Touch and mouse optimized GUI (Python GUI/HTML,CSS GUI)
- possibility to choose only one streaming service to use as normal
- possibility to create service-overlapping playlists
---
- API's need user login for service, login data stored in .txt or .json file
